<h1 style="font-family: Bahnschrift Light">The Top Five Best "The Office" Characters</h1>
<h2 style="font-family: Bahnschrift Light"> The List:</h2>
<d1>
<dt>#1. Michael Scott</dt>

<dd> The one who starts the show, Michael Gary Scott plays an astronomical part in what makes "The Office" so great. Steve Carrel does a wonderful job portraying him, as he really made Michael his own. His antics were the best part of the show and he is one of, if not the most, memorable character.</dd>

<dt>#2. Jim Halpert</dt>

<dd> Although I am quite torn between placing Jim or Dwight in this spot, I chose Jim because he made so many key events happen in the show. He gave us a great love story and caused Dwight to be picked as regional manager in season nine. He also had well written character growth, so for all those reasons he is number two. </dd>

<dt>#3. Dwight Schrute</dt>

<dd> As the most intense character in "The Office", Dwight sets an example of what it is like to be goal oriented. His ability to be hilarious with even realizing is one of the many reasons that Dwight is in the top three. His enemy to friend storyline with Jim is one of my favorites and his willingness to protect the ones he loves is what makes him a favorite among fans.</dd>

<dt>#4. Andrew Bernard</dt>

<dd> I donâ€™t really like Andy, but I cannot deny that he played an important role in the later seasons. I do appreciate his character growth; he goes from being a rude suck up to a caring (although a bit theatrical) and genuine guy. He gets betrayed many times and eventually just becomes the butt of a joke, so I wish he had a better ending. </dd>
    
<dt>#5. Pam Beesly</dt>

<dd> I also dislike Pam, not for her personality but for her actions. She made so many poor choices but inspired many because of how she prevailed. She was always the voice of reason and tried her best to manage Michael. She overcame her cowardliness and became more confident in herself which many fans appreciate. </dd>
